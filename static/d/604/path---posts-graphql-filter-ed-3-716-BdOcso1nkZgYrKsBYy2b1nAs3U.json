{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Yes, I made the switch to an uglier but more understandable home webpage. </p>\n<p>The way I currently have my site set up, I have 3 main pages: first the homepage, which is on <code>index.js</code>, an <code>about.js</code> page, and a <code>contact.js</code> page. I may switch this later to have about and contact on the same page, and have a projects page instead.</p>\n<p>On the <code>index.js</code> page, there is a GraphQL query, which filters what gets displayed on my index page. First, I look for all markdown files (files in my directory that are .md), and filter and sort it according layout and date, respectively. You can see that when I do <code>filter: { frontmatter: {layout: {eq: \"post\"}}}</code>, it uses a Sift syntax, which is used in MongoDB, to filter for all markdown files that have a layout entry in the frontmatter that is labeled \"post\". This is because I also have markdown files for my about, and contact pages, but I want to ensure only the ones that have \"post\" in the front matter get displayed.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to use GraphQL to choose what shows up on your page"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/graphql_filter/"}}
