This includes anything from dev boards to etched plastic enclosures. Now that we receive packages so often, it is not very easy to keep track of when a package is supposed to be arriving, and we don't always get notifications when items get held up in customs or get lost in the process. Once again APIs are here to save the day.</p>\n<p>In the ideal scenario, we could create a Chrome extension with a trained machine learning algorithm that can detect whether a purchase has been made for a delivery, guess the delivery timeframe, store the delivery in a database, and automatically alert the user if today's date is later than the anticipated delivery date. However, even this scenario doesn't account for company purchases made with a purchase order system, which is why procurement teams exist.</p>\n<p>Given that I am no genius, an idiot's backup to the system above is to use a slack slash command to automatically update a simple database, like a spreadsheet in Google Sheets for example.

In our case, we can just use Google Apps script to set up this endpoint. Anything written after the /delivery command will be sent to the endpoint, and we can create the script to parse this text message using regular expressions (regex). Google Apps Script will handle the request through a <code>doPost()</code> function that you must write.

The going is quite slow, and the results are also quite ugly, but after trying to figure out GraphQL and aggravating myself over backticks, at least I have something.\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simjxu/simjxu.github.io/master/img/gatsby1.jpg\" alt=\"gatsby-1\"></p>\n<p>I'll also push the gatsby version of this site onto github here: <a href=\"https://github.com/simjxu/gatsby-themush\">https://github.com/simjxu/gatsby-themush</a>. You're probably wondering, what's the point of pushing something so useless onto github?  Well, my plan is to continue iterating on this Gatsby blog, and I also intend to litter the darn thing with comments. Hopefully this will help others understand the nuances of building a site. I don't have many comments yet, but stay tuned and I expect there to be more commentary than there is code.</p>\n<p>The tutorial does a good job at helping you understand how GraphQL allows different page components to query particular items. One of the first uses of GraphQL is to swap out any mention of the website title with a <code>{data.site.siteMetadata.title}</code>. This does a page query to another file that must be titled gatsby-config.js to determine the website's metadata, like its title. This means that anytime a title is referenced, it queries the metadata. If the website title were to change at any point, then they can all be changed because of the query.</p>\n<p>Another place where queries are used are for the blog posts. You can set GraphQL to automatically filter out any markdown file within your \"pages\" folder on Gatsby and list them on the homepage of the website. This is any file that ends in .md. To create that query that can point to the blogposts, you need to create a path to the location, and for some reason they call this a \"slug\". The page can then be created by using two Gatsby APIs, <code>onCreateNode</code> and <code>createPages</code>. </p>\n<p>To be continued.</p>","transformer-remark-markdown-html-ast-85c2013d9194cd43252cafb2bfe61c32--":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Yes, I made the switch to an uglier but more basic home webpage.

This includes anything from dev boards to etched plastic enclosures. Now that we receive packages so often, it is not very easy to keep track of when a package is supposed to be arriving, and we don't always get notifications when items get held up in customs or get lost in the process. Once again APIs are here to save the day.</p>\n<p>In the ideal scenario, we could create a Chrome extension with a trained machine learning algorithm that can detect whether a purchase has been made for a delivery, guess the delivery timeframe, store the delivery in a database, and automatically alert the user if today's date is later than the anticipated delivery date. However, even this scenario doesn't account for company purchases made with a purchase order system, which is why procurement teams exist.</p>\n<p>Given that I am no genius, an idiot's backup to the system above is to use a slack slash command to automatically update a simple database, like a spreadsheet in Google Sheets for example. Then, using an incoming webhook, send an alert if it is past the delivery date for the package, triggered once every day to a channel, perhaps called #deliveryalerts. If there are no packages that are supposed to be delivered already, no alerts. </p>\n<p>We can first create a simple spreadsheet database like this:\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simjxu/simjxu.github.io/master/img/vendor_spreadsheet.jpg\" alt=\"vendor-spreadsheet\">\nThis would show the item that is being delivered, the estimated delivery date, and a boolean Yes/No as to whether the item has been received.</p>\n<p>Then, we can create the #deliveryalerts channel in Slack, and integrate a Slack incoming webhook that points to #deliveryalerts and a slash command. In this case, we create one called /delivery. /delivery will send a post request to some endpoint that you need to define (a url). In our case, we can just use Google Apps script to set up this endpoint. Anything written after the /delivery command will be sent to the endpoint, and we can create the script to parse this text message using regular expressions (regex). Google Apps Script will handle the request through a <code>doPost()</code> function that you must write. Just take the spreadsheet that you want to set as your deliveries database, and on the Tools menu select script editor. Copy the <code>doPost()</code> example below into the Code.gs file.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Handle the Post request, based upon the command that is written after the slash command\nfunction doPost(e){\n  var commandReceived = e.parameter[\"text\"];\n\n  if (commandReceived.match(/help/)) showHelp();            // showHelp() is run when slack user types: /delivery help\n  if (commandReceived.match(/list/)) listDeliveries();\n  if (commandReceived.match(/add/)) add(e);\n  if (commandReceived.match(/remove/)) remove(e);           // remove(e) is run after slack user types: /delivery remove someItem\n  if (commandReceived.match(/received/)) received(e);\n  \n  // Need to create a return, otherwise slack will complain that there was no response created\n  var returnMessage = \"send complete\";\n  return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({text:returnMessage})).setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Slack complains if there is no return message, so I've also included just a simple \"send complete\" at the end of the <code>doPost()</code> function. Now, all you need to do is create the functions to handle each of the if statements in <code>doPost()</code>. An example of this function can be seen here, for marking a delivery as received. Notice that regular expressions are used to determine the format for the string that is attached to the slash command.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function received(e){\n  var receiver = e.parameter[\"user_name\"];\n  var messageReceived = e.parameter[\"text\"].trim();\n  var regex = /received ([a-zA-Z0-9-_\\s]+)/;\n  var matches = regex.exec(messageReceived);\n  var deliveryName = matches[1];\n  var sheet = getStatusSheet();\n  var affectedRow = getDeliveryRow(deliveryName);\n  \n  if (affectedRow) {\n    sheet.getRange(\"D\" + (affectedRow)).setValue('Y');\n    getLogger().log(\"%s received delivery %s\", receiver, deliveryName);\n    listDeliveries();\n  } else {\n    sendMessage(\"*\" + deliveryName + \"* delivery not found\");\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then there's the timed triggers.
