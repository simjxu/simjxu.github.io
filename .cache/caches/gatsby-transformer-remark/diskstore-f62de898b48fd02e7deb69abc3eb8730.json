This creates a .sublime-syntax file which you can use to edit what color the text will show as. Under the \"match:\" key value pair, you use regex to determine which types of text it matches. In the example shown below, I have dates with a newline character highlight as orange. The orange color for the Mariana theme matches the \"scope:\" key value pair of constant.numeric. What I essentially had done was look in the Mariana.sublime-color-scheme file to determine that this scope was an orange color.\nTypically, this file is found in Sublime Text 3 >> Packages >> User\nMy file is called Plain text.sublime-syntax</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">%YAML 1.2\n---\n# http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/syntax.html\nname: Regular Text\nfile_extensions:\n  - txt\nscope: text.plain\ncontexts:\n  main:\n    # Dates\n    - comment: Dates\n      match: '[0-9]{1,2}(/)[0-9]{1,2}(/)[0-9]{1,2}\\n'\n      scope: constant.numeric\n      pop: true\n    # Highlight Plan\n    - comment: Plan (case-insensitive)\n      match: \\b(?:Plan)\\b\n      scope: support.function\n</code></pre>\n<p>Results:\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simjxu/simjxu.github.io/gh-pages/img/sublime-highlight.jpg\" alt=\"sublime_pic\"></p>"}
