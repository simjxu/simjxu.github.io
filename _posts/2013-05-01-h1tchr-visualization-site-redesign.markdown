  Client wanted to allow users to create connections between different songs and artists on a number of different levels such as similar melodies, samples, lyrics etc...
</p>

<p>
  I designed and developed the Spotify h1tchr app which supplied extra information about the artist you were listening to. Full artist credits, gallery photos, related albums and wikipedia information all pulled from different APIs.

  I also helped him simplify his complex confusing visualizations on the web front end into a simpler model.
