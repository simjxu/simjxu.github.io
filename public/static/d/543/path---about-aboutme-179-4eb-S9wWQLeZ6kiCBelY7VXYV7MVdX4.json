{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I'm yet another experienced \"professional\" engineer who enjoys the outdoors and the occassional can of sparkling water. But really, who doesn't? I suppose what differentiates me is that I love doing comedy (improv, standup), and will never pass up an opportunity to hear myself talk. Also, I've made it one of my goals to win a lifetime supply of Chipotle burritos. If you ever wonder what my motives are, there it is.</p>\n<p>My free time involves a combination of programming side projects, comedy, rock climbing, perfecting my vitamin mush recipe, and leading bible study for the church I attend. </p>\n<h3>my history</h3>\n<p>I started my engineering journey at UC Berkeley, where I specialized in Mech E. I began my first job out of college working for the US department of Defense, where I worked on naval weapons. Then transitioned to another facility where I worked on nuclear submarines, developing in-house software tools.</p>\n<p>I finally stopped working for the Feds after 4 years and transitioned to IoT, where I am now.</p>\n<h3>contact</h3>\n<p>Contact me at simjxu@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Click <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q0AotX0TWgyPH8cb4qUJzP86Df8tJu84/view\">here</a> for my resume. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About Me"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about/aboutme/"}}
