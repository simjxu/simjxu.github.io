I'm yet another experienced "professional" engineer who enjoys the outdoors and the occassional can of sparkling water. But really, who doesn't? I suppose what differentiates me is that I love doing comedy (improv, standup), and will never pass up an opportunity to hear myself talk. Also, I've made it one of my goals to win a lifetime supply of Chipotle burritos. If you ever wonder what my motives are, there it is.

My free time involves a combination of programming side projects, comedy, rock climbing, perfecting my vitamin mush recipe, and leading bible study for the church I attend. 

### my history

I started my engineering journey at UC Berkeley, where I specialized in Mech E. I began my first job out of college working for the US department of Defense, where I worked on naval weapons. Then transitioned to another facility where I worked on nuclear submarines, developing in-house software tools.

I finally stopped working for the Feds after 4 years and transitioned to IoT, where I am now.
