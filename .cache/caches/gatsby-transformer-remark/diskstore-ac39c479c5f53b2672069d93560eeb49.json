Commitment is hard, and you never know if a blog will actually continue far past the first few posts. Anyway, this blog is intended to record me as I self-teach web development. Follow along if you're on the same page. Luckily, I'm not really starting from scratch, at this point I've been working for 8 years. 3 of those years I've spent working in IoT. I've developed tools in MATLAB, Python, LabVIEW, Squirrel/C, and also done a tiny bit of node development, mostly to create an endpoint for my Electric Imp module post requests. </p>\n<p>I used to focus primarily on hardware work, and my old blog talked nearly exclusively about digital signal processing (<a href=\"https://simonxu.wordpress.com/\">https://simonxu.wordpress.com/</a>). I was also a lot less funny then. Now this will be my new blog. I'm using github pages with jekyll and I'm using a template someone else came up with (credit is on the bottom of the page).</p>\n<p>Recently, I decided that hardware is too hard, and thus begins my switch. No guarantees. I'm going rock climbing.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var blog = require('persistence');\n</code></pre>"}
