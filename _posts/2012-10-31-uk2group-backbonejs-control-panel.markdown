  uk2group are one of the largest hosting providers, they needed a new admin system for their admin users and resellers.  Users could manage their hosting products, add and remove new options, transfer products, manage transations, submit support tickets.  Most of these were version 1 deliverables.  It has since been extended, maintained, and used in production.
