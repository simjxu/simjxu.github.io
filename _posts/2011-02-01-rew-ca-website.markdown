<p>
	As part of a team of 3 engineers â€“ delivered this real estate portal based in Vancouver built using Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, javascript.
</p>
<p>
  This was my first major ruby on rails project, on rails 2.3, I learned a lot about convention over configuration, filters, templating, haml / erb, mvc and helpers and gems.
