So this post will outline the plans and requirements for the different modularized microservices that I will make as part of my project, in app.simonxu.com.</p>\n<p><em>Microservice 1: Database Display</em>\nThe first one will be the most basic, it will update to show the contents of a firebase datastore including key-value pairs that are in my firebase database. This will update automatically </p>\n<p><em>Microservice 2: REST API</em>\nThis will be some basic GET, POST, PUT, DELETE actions from REST based communication. I should be able to use the API I create to make requests vias Postman.</p>\n<p><em>Microservice 3: GraphQL API</em>\nThis one will be a little fancier, using GraphQL to pick up specific items in my database. Creating an API that uses GraphQL will help me understand it better.</p>\n<p>To make actions using the API, I will also need to set up a token-based authentication system using OAuth2, and in order to test it out, I will make a time based trigger which will update a \"date\" key with the current date in UTC once day. Probably in the beginning I will avoid having to do refreshes on the token, but once I understand it more I will add some code that can automatically do the token refresh.</p>\n<p>All of this will be orchestrated using Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>If there is time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>machine learning stuff</li>\n</ul>"}
