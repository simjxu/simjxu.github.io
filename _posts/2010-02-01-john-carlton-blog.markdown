<p>
	Redesigned John Carltonâ€™s Copywriting blog, giving it a professional broadsheet newspaper look.

  I also really got into online conversion and optimization, experimenting with different theories on landing pages and homepages to increase list opt in rates and product sales. I used Google In Page Analytics and Clicktale to report results.  Trying things such as moving opt in box above the fold, highlighting product section, adding most popular posts section. Split testing a landing pages with / without photo testimonials - photos winning with 80% uptake.
  I ended up using the findings in an hour presentation for bloggers to improve their own sites, attached a snapshot of some of the slides at the bottom.
