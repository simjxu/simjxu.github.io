<p>
	A fully functioning lego chess robot that would complete a move in less than 2 minutes.
</p>
<p>
  Four of us built it as our final year university project.
  After researching different solutions to read the chess board, the most reliable would be for the user to push down the pieces on a board with switches.  We built the custom wooden board with 64 switches, one under each square, the board would output 1 of 64 different possible voltage levels that the computer would read.  An open source chess playing engine was used, given the move it would send it instructions to the lego mindstorms controller on the piece to move.  It supported killing pieces by first removing the target piece, castling, en passant.
