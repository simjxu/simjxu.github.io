I'm always snooping around for a good deal. I recently took advantage of several promotional programs from food delivery startups in San Francisco, and scored myself several delicious meals (din.co, Blue Apron, Munchery). Heavy competition among food startups is equivalent to a full belly for me.

In the past months I discovered something else: I could get free webhosting through using Github pages. Thus, I've begun my exploration into using Jekyll and developing a simple webpage to hold all my stuff.
