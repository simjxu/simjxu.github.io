{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>To create a new syntax, go to Tools >> Developer >> New Syntax. This creates a .sublime-syntax file which you can use to edit what color the text will show as. Under the \"match:\" key value pair, you use regex to determine which types of text it matches. In the example shown below, I have dates with a newline character highlight as orange. The orange color for the Mariana theme matches the \"scope:\" key value pair of constant.numeric. What I essentially had done was look in the Mariana.sublime-color-scheme file to determine that this scope was an orange color.</p>\n<p>Typically, this file is found in Sublime Text 3 >> Packages >> User.
